	  The IEEE 1588 standard defines a method to precisely
	  synchronize distributed clocks over Ethernet networks. The
	  standard defines a Precision Time Protocol (PTP), which can
	  be used to achieve synchronization within a few dozen
	  microseconds. In addition, with the help of special hardware
	  time stamping units, it can be possible to achieve
	  synchronization to within a few hundred nanoseconds.

	  This driver adds support for PTP clocks as character
	  devices. If you want to use a PTP clock, then you should
	  also enable at least one clock driver as well.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called ptp.
