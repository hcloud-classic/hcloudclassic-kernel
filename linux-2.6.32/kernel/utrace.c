/*
 * Per-thread structure private to utrace implementation.
 * If task_struct.utrace_flags is nonzero, task_struct.utrace
 * has always been allocated first.  Once allocated, it is
 * never freed until free_task().
 *
 * The common event reporting loops are done by the task making the
 * report without ever taking any locks.  To facilitate this, the two
 * lists @attached and @attaching work together for smooth asynchronous
 * attaching with low overhead.  Modifying either list requires @lock.
 * The @attaching list can be modified any time while holding @lock.
 * New engines being attached always go on this list.
 *
 * The @attached list is what the task itself uses for its reporting
 * loops.  When the task itself is not quiescent, it can use the
 * @attached list without taking any lock.  Nobody may modify the list
 * when the task is not quiescent.  When it is quiescent, that means
 * that it won't run again without taking @lock itself before using
 * the list.
 *
 * At each place where we know the task is quiescent (or it's current),
 * while holding @lock, we call splice_attaching(), below.  This moves
 * the @attaching list members on to the end of the @attached list.
 * Since this happens at the start of any reporting pass, any new
 * engines attached asynchronously go on the stable @attached list
 * in time to have their callbacks seen.

/**
 * utrace_control - control a thread being traced by a tracing engine
 * @target:		thread to affect
 * @engine:		attached engine to affect
 * @action:		&enum utrace_resume_action for thread to do
 *
 * This is how a tracing engine asks a traced thread to do something.
 * This call is controlled by the @action argument, which has the
 * same meaning as the &enum utrace_resume_action value returned by
 * event reporting callbacks.
 *
 * If @target is already dead (@target->exit_state nonzero),
 * all actions except %UTRACE_DETACH fail with -%ESRCH.
 *
 * The following sections describe each option for the @action argument.
 *
 * UTRACE_DETACH:
 *
 * After this, the @engine data structure is no longer accessible,
 * and the thread might be reaped.  The thread will start running
 * again if it was stopped and no longer has any attached engines
 * that want it stopped.
 *
 * If the @report_reap callback may already have begun, this fails
 * with -%ESRCH.  If the @report_death callback may already have
 * begun, this fails with -%EALREADY.
 *
 * If @target is not already stopped, then a callback to this engine
 * might be in progress or about to start on another CPU.  If so,
 * then this returns -%EINPROGRESS; the detach happens as soon as
 * the pending callback is finished.  To synchronize after an
 * -%EINPROGRESS return, see utrace_barrier().
 *
 * If @target is properly stopped before utrace_control() is called,
 * then after successful return it's guaranteed that no more callbacks
 * to the @engine->ops vector will be made.
 *
 * The only exception is %SIGKILL (and exec or group-exit by another
 * thread in the group), which can cause asynchronous @report_death
 * and/or @report_reap callbacks even when %UTRACE_STOP was used.
 * (In that event, this fails with -%ESRCH or -%EALREADY, see above.)
 *
 * UTRACE_STOP:
 *
 * This asks that @target stop running.  This returns 0 only if
 * @target is already stopped, either for tracing or for job
 * control.  Then @target will remain stopped until another
 * utrace_control() call is made on @engine; @target can be woken
 * only by %SIGKILL (or equivalent, such as exec or termination by
 * another thread in the same thread group).
 *
 * This returns -%EINPROGRESS if @target is not already stopped.
 * Then the effect is like %UTRACE_REPORT.  A @report_quiesce or
 * @report_signal callback will be made soon.  Your callback can
 * then return %UTRACE_STOP to keep @target stopped.
 *
 * This does not interrupt system calls in progress, including ones
 * that sleep for a long time.  For that, use %UTRACE_INTERRUPT.
 * To interrupt system calls and then keep @target stopped, your
 * @report_signal callback can return %UTRACE_STOP.
 *
 * UTRACE_RESUME:
 *
 * Just let @target continue running normally, reversing the effect
 * of a previous %UTRACE_STOP.  If another engine is keeping @target
 * stopped, then it remains stopped until all engines let it resume.
 * If @target was not stopped, this has no effect.
 *
 * UTRACE_REPORT:
 *
 * This is like %UTRACE_RESUME, but also ensures that there will be
 * a @report_quiesce or @report_signal callback made soon.  If
 * @target had been stopped, then there will be a callback before it
 * resumes running normally.  If another engine is keeping @target
 * stopped, then there might be no callbacks until all engines let
 * it resume.
 *
 * Since this is meaningless unless @report_quiesce callbacks will
 * be made, it returns -%EINVAL if @engine lacks %UTRACE_EVENT(%QUIESCE).
 *
 * UTRACE_INTERRUPT:
 *
 * This is like %UTRACE_REPORT, but ensures that @target will make a
 * @report_signal callback before it resumes or delivers signals.
 * If @target was in a system call or about to enter one, work in
 * progress will be interrupted as if by %SIGSTOP.  If another
 * engine is keeping @target stopped, then there might be no
 * callbacks until all engines let it resume.
 *
 * This gives @engine an opportunity to introduce a forced signal
 * disposition via its @report_signal callback.
 *
 * UTRACE_SINGLESTEP:
 *
 * It's invalid to use this unless arch_has_single_step() returned true.
 * This is like %UTRACE_RESUME, but resumes for one user instruction only.
 *
 * Note that passing %UTRACE_SINGLESTEP or %UTRACE_BLOCKSTEP to
 * utrace_control() or returning it from an event callback alone does
 * not necessarily ensure that stepping will be enabled.  If there are
 * more callbacks made to any engine before returning to user mode,
 * then the resume action is chosen only by the last set of callbacks.
 * To be sure, enable %UTRACE_EVENT(%QUIESCE) and look for the
 * @report_quiesce callback with a zero event mask, or the
 * @report_signal callback with %UTRACE_SIGNAL_REPORT.
 *
 * Since this is not robust unless @report_quiesce callbacks will
 * be made, it returns -%EINVAL if @engine lacks %UTRACE_EVENT(%QUIESCE).
 *
 * UTRACE_BLOCKSTEP:
 *
 * It's invalid to use this unless arch_has_block_step() returned true.
 * This is like %UTRACE_SINGLESTEP, but resumes for one whole basic
 * block of user instructions.
 *
 * Since this is not robust unless @report_quiesce callbacks will
 * be made, it returns -%EINVAL if @engine lacks %UTRACE_EVENT(%QUIESCE).
 *
 * %UTRACE_BLOCKSTEP devolves to %UTRACE_SINGLESTEP when another
 * tracing engine is using %UTRACE_SINGLESTEP at the same time.

 * When @target is current, this call is superfluous.  When @target is

 * This means a zero return from a utrace_control() call on @engine giving
 * %UTRACE_STOP, or a report_quiesce() or report_signal() callback to
 * @engine that used %UTRACE_STOP in its return value.
 *
 * Returns -%ESRCH if @target is dead or -%EINVAL if %UTRACE_STOP was
 * not used.  If @target has started running again despite %UTRACE_STOP
 * (for %SIGKILL or a spurious wakeup), this call returns -%EAGAIN.
 *
 * When this call returns zero, it's safe to use &struct user_regset
 * calls and task_user_regset_view() on @target and to examine some of
 * its fields directly.  When the examination is complete, a
