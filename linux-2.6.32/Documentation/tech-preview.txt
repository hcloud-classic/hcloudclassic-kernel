This document lists the currently known drivers that are considered
in tech preview.  Drivers in 'tech preview' are not fully supported
yet and are expected to still have some bugs that need to be worked
out.

Please keep this list up-to-date as it will be used by groups for
customer service.

To mark your driver as 'tech preview', please add the following line
to your code in a spot that is specific to the code that is marked as
'tech preview' (ie module_init, quirks, etc).

mark_tech_preview(const char *msg, struct module *module);

msg - custom string to print to the screen (otherwise it uses
    module->name if NULL)
module - for modules, use THIS_MODULE. If built-in, then use NULL here (but
    make sure 'msg' is filled in)
